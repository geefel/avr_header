AVR274: Single-wire Software UART 

A  timer  compare  interrupt  is  used  to  generate  the  bit  sampling  and  bit  transmission  
intervals. The timer is set in Clear Timer on Compare (CTC) mode and to generate an 
interrupt when the timer equals the output compare register. The time between each 
interrupt is dependent on the system clock, timer prescaler and value in the compare 
register as shown in Equation 3-1. Setting the compare value to 10 will generate 11 
ticks  between  each  interrupt.  Baud  rate  settings  are  set  in  the  UART  header  file  
(single_wire_UART.h).

Baudrate Berechnen
    Baud Rate = Systemclock / ((OnePeriodCompareSetting + 1) * TimerPrescale)

OnePeriodCompareSetting (OCR-Zahl)
    OnePeriodCompareSetting = (SystemClock / (BaudRate * TimerPrescale)) - 1

Error
    Error[%] = ((BautRateAmNÃ¤chsten / BaudRate) - 1) * 100% 

Please  note  that  there  is  a  maximum  setting  for  the  baud  rate.  This  is  because  the  
timer  interrupt  has  to  be  finished  before  a  new  interrupt  is  generated.  Equation  3-4 
gives  the  maximum  baud  rate  possible.  The  interrupt  must  finish  before  a  new  
compare interrupt is triggered. The maximum cycles in a compare interrupt are about 
100-110  depending  on  the  compiler  settings.  Using  a  1MHz  system  clock  the  
maximum  baud  rate  is  about  10,000  bit/s.  The  UART  will  consume  about  all  CPU  
resources  when  communicating  at  this  baud  rate.  The  application  using  the  UART  
must also have time to read the received data before a new frame is received, or else 
an  overflow  error  will  occur.  It  is  recommended  to  set  the  baud  rate  well  below  the  
maximum setting depending on the application.

Maximum Baud Rate Setting 
    BaudRate < SystemClock / MaximumCyclesInCompareInterrupt
